## Deployment Fixes Applied (2025-12-26)

### [x] Fixed Netlify Deployment Errors

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ `Identifier 'initCoreHelpers' already declared` - Removed problematic ESM.sh CDN importmap that was causing duplicate library loading
- ✅ `index.css 404` - Created index.css file with global styles and imported it in index.tsx
- ✅ `index.tsx MIME type error` - Updated HTML script reference to use proper relative path (`./index.tsx` instead of `/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Blank page display - Added proper CSS import and fixed module loading

**Files Modified/Created:**
1. **netlify.toml** (new) - Added proper Netlify build configuration:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - SPA redirect rule for client-side routing
   
2. **public/_redirects** (new) - Added SPA redirect rule: `/* /index.html 200`

3. **index.css** (new) - Global CSS file with:
   - Font imports
   - Reset styles
   - Utility classes (.glass, .text-gradient, .bg-mesh)
   - Root element styling

4. **index.tsx** - Added `import './index.css'` to import global styles

5. **index.html** - Removed problematic ESM.sh importmap and changed script reference to `./index.tsx`

6. **vite.config.ts** - Added build configuration for minification and output directory

**How to Deploy:**
1. Commit the changes to your repository
2. Push to your Git repository connected to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically:
   - Run `npm run build` 
   - Build Vite project to `dist/` directory
   - Serve the built files with proper SPA routing

The fixes ensure that:
- Vite properly transpiles TypeScript/TSX to JavaScript
- CSS is properly bundled and loaded
- SPA routing works correctly on Netlify
- No duplicate library declarations occur

## Workflow Steps

### [ ] Step: Requirements

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects. For unclear aspects: - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if: - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications - No reasonable default exists - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

## Requirements*

## Success Criteria*

```

Save the PRD into `c:\Users\SRIKANTH KOMATI\Downloads\portfolio\portfolio\srikanth-k---senior-ui-portfolio\.zencoder\chats\5a46ce39-68d4-4753-ade0-4987bf52876b/requirements.md`.

### [ ] Step: Technical Specification

Based on the PRD in `c:\Users\SRIKANTH KOMATI\Downloads\portfolio\portfolio\srikanth-k---senior-ui-portfolio\.zencoder\chats\5a46ce39-68d4-4753-ade0-4987bf52876b/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `c:\Users\SRIKANTH KOMATI\Downloads\portfolio\portfolio\srikanth-k---senior-ui-portfolio\.zencoder\chats\5a46ce39-68d4-4753-ade0-4987bf52876b/spec.md`.

### [ ] Step: Implementation Plan

Based on the technical spec in `c:\Users\SRIKANTH KOMATI\Downloads\portfolio\portfolio\srikanth-k---senior-ui-portfolio\.zencoder\chats\5a46ce39-68d4-4753-ade0-4987bf52876b/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `c:\Users\SRIKANTH KOMATI\Downloads\portfolio\portfolio\srikanth-k---senior-ui-portfolio\.zencoder\chats\5a46ce39-68d4-4753-ade0-4987bf52876b/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

Format each task as

```
### [ ] Step: <task_name>
Task instructions
```
